# Appointment_NoShow
Analysis of dataset to predict the reason of no-show for a dental appointment.

## Description
This dataset includes information from 100k medical appointments in Brazil. <br>

A number of characteristics about the patient are included in each row.<br>
‘ScheduledDay’ tells us on what day the patient set up their appointment.<br>
‘Neighborhood’ indicates the location of the hospital.<br>
‘Scholarship’ indicates whether or not the patient is enrolled in Brasilian welfare program Bolsa Família.<br>
In the last column, if it says ‘No’ then the patient showed up to their appointment, and if it says ‘Yes’ then they did not show up.<br>
